🚗 Vehicle Claim Fraud Prediction

A Machine Learning project to detect fraudulent vehicle insurance claims using data-driven predictive modeling.

📊 Overview

Insurance fraud is a major financial drain in the vehicle insurance sector.
This project leverages Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to predict whether a vehicle insurance claim is genuine or fraudulent based on key claim parameters.

🧠 Objectives

Analyze vehicle claim data for hidden fraud patterns

Preprocess and clean raw datasets

Apply ML models like Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Evaluate performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score
